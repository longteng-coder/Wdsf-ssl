This is a implementation of the paper “A Weld Defect Segmentation Framework Based on Visual Self-Supervised Learning”


* This repo is based on [`MAE in PyTorch+GPU`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae). Installation and preparation follow that repo.


* Radiographic inspection of weld defect dataset(RTWD) is constructed by a semi-automatic data extraction engine. Detailed explanation in [RTWD.md](RTWD/RTWD.md).



* Implementation of multi-head decoding segmentation is in [ssf_seg.py](ssf_seg.py).
* At present, in order to ensure the originality of the research, we have set permissions for the code and data, which will be made public together with the paper.
